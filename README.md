Surrogate Modeling
==================

... is an umbrella term for approximations of building energy models
using Machine Learning (ML) or algorithmic approach, as compared to
(slower) simulations. This repository contains utilities and models
to replicate [ResStock dataset](https://resstock.nrel.gov/) 
using Surrogate Modeling.
