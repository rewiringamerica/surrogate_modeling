# Surrogate Modeling

Surrogate modeling is an umbrella term for approximations of building energy models using machine learning (ML) or algorithmic approaches, as compared to (slower) simulations. This repository contains utilities and models to replicate the [ResStock dataset](https://resstock.nrel.gov/) using surrogate modeling techniques.

This code was developed in and depends on Databricks.

## Documentation

The steps run the training pipleine can be found [here](scripts/readme.md), and the details on versioning and model artifacts can be found [here](model_artifacts/readme.md).

More technical documentation is available in the following locations:

- [Architecture Overview](docs/architecture.md)
- [Features & Upgrades](docs/features_upgrades.md)

### Deprecation Notice

There are two deprecated versions of the model stored in `deprecated/` that are no longer maintained.

## Installation

This repository is designed to be run on Databricks and follows the conventions of the [dml-sample-transmission-line](https://github.com/rewiringamerica/dml-sample-transmission-line) repository. Please review its README for details on setup and usage patterns.

We currently run this project on clusters with DB 14.3 LTS runtime (Python 3.10).

### Cluster Setup

To configure the cluster:

1. Upload `install-db-requirements.sh` to Advanced Options > Init Script in your cluster settings.
2. Restart the cluster for changes to take effect.

### Updating Requirements

Whenever you add a requirement to `pyproject.toml`, follow these steps:

1. Run `poetry update`.
2. Generate requirements files with `dml-gen-requirements` as described in the [dml-sample-transmission-line README](https://github.com/rewiringamerica/dml-sample-transmission-line).
