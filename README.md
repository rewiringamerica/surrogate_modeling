# Surrogate Modeling

... is an umbrella term for approximations of building energy models
using Machine Learning (ML) or algorithmic approach, as compared to
(slower) simulations. This repository contains utilities and models
to replicate [ResStock dataset](https://resstock.nrel.gov/)
using Surrogate Modeling.


This code was developed in and depends on Databricks.

More technical documentation will be added in the future, but for now see [Architechture](docs/architecture.md) and [Features & Upgrades](docs/features_upgrades.md).

Note that there are two other version of this model that are stored in `deprecated/` that are not being maintained.
